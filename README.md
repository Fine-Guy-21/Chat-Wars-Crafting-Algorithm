# Chat Wars Crafting Simulator

**Crafting Simulator** is a web-based application designed to simulate and calculate crafting and brewing algorithms for games. It offers two primary functionalities: **Alchemist Brewing Algorithm** and **Blacksmith Crafting Algorithm**. The project is designed with modern, responsive web technologies and provides an intuitive interface for inputting resources, calculating outputs, and displaying results.



## Features

- **Alchemist Brewing Algorithm**:  
  Allows users to input alchemical resources and calculates crafting results based on predefined recipes and algorithms.  
  Displays results dynamically with detailed ingredient breakdowns.

- **Blacksmith Crafting Algorithm**:  
  Enables users to calculate crafting results for blacksmithing resources, with clear and organized outputs.  
  Includes support for craft levels and their impact on calculations.

- **Modern UI/UX**:  
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes.  
  - Clean, user-friendly interface with real-time feedback and dynamic result displays.  




## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web interface.  
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.  
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality, including calculations and DOM manipulation.
